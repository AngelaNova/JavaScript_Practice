<h1> YouTube Project Documentation </h1>


### Project Overview:
This project is a clone of the YouTube website, aiming to replicate its user interface and functionality.

### HTML Structure:
- **`<header>`:** Contains the header section of the webpage, including the YouTube logo, search bar, upload button, notification button, and user profile button.
- **`<nav>`:** Represents the sidebar navigation menu containing links to different sections of the website.
- **`<main>`:** Contains the main content area where video previews are displayed in a grid layout.

### CSS Styling:

#### Header (`header.css`):
- The header section is styled with a fixed position at the top of the page.
- It consists of three sections: left, middle, and right sections.
- The search bar and buttons are styled for responsiveness and interaction.
- Media queries are used to adjust the layout based on the screen width.

#### Sidebar (`sidebar.css`):
- The sidebar navigation menu is styled with a fixed position on the left side of the page.
- It contains links to different sections of the website, with icons and tooltips for each link.
- Media queries are used to adjust the width and layout of the sidebar for different screen sizes.

#### Video Previews (`video.css`):
- Thumbnails of videos are styled with border-radius and width set to 100%.
- Video time display is positioned at the bottom right corner of each thumbnail.
- Video titles, authors, and statistics are styled for readability and consistency.
- Grid layout is used for arranging video previews in the main content area.
- Media queries adjust the layout and font sizes based on the screen width.

#### General Styling (`general.css`):
- Body styling includes setting margins, padding, background color, and font family.
- Media queries adjust the padding for different screen widths to ensure proper layout and spacing.

### Overall:
- The project effectively replicates the layout and styling of the YouTube website.
- HTML structure and CSS styling are organized and consistent.
